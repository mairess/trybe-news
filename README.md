# Transforming Data into News 🚀

## About the Project 📄

This is a React project that aims to transform data into news. It uses the IBGE news API to create a page that displays the most recent news in an organized and intuitive manner.

## Features 💡

- **Recent News**: Displays the most recent news from IBGE.
- **Access to Full News**: Each news item in the list can be clicked to access the complete news article.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark their favorite news for easy access in the future.
- **Filters**: Users can filter news by type, favorites, and title.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **React with TypeScript**: React was used in conjunction with TypeScript to build the user interface. React allows for the creation of interactive and efficient user interfaces, and TypeScript adds a layer of security to our code by providing static typing and intelligent autocompletion during development.

- **Context API**: The Context API was used to manage the global state of the application. This allows for easy data sharing between different components without the need for prop drilling.

- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks were created to encapsulate component logic that can be reused in various components. This helps keep the code clean and facilitates maintenance.

- **Styled-Components**: Styled-Components was used for styling the application. This library allows for writing CSS styles in a more intuitive and efficient way, encapsulating the scope of styles within components.

- **Responsiveness**: The application is fully responsive and can be used on devices of different sizes.
